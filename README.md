In the data-driven approach, the large number of data is essential to avoid over fitting. Therefore, the augmentation is required to artificially increase the number of data, especially when the number of data is not sufficient. There are three main technique to augment the data in music.
Time stretching, pitch shifting and adding noise to the original music signal: Time stretching is the process of increasing or decreasing the speed or duration of the music without affecting its pitch. For time-stretching, at first, short time Fourier transform (STFT) of audio data is computed. Then we draw two randomly chosen stretching or shrinking rates from the uniform distribution in the interval. Then the STFT matrix of time-frequency representation is stretched or shorten based on the phase vocodor After the time stretching, the resulting time-frequency representation can be transformed back into the audio data in time dimension with the inverse of short time Fourier transform (ISTFT). The algorithm for time stretching is shown in Figure
